The word FABRIC is useed to define the Scalability and Elasticity

we cannot set auto-scaling rules based on error messages. Auto-scaling rules are kicked-off based on CPU/Memory usages and not due to some given error or 
disk space issues.

We CANNOT use Shared Load balancer to load balance APIs on customer hosted runtimes. Load balancing is not provided for Hybrid deployments, but we can manage load balance with 
the tools connected to ourr on-premises resources. 

For Hybrid deployment models, the on-premises are first connected to Runtime Manager using Runtime Manager agent. So, the connection is initiated first from 
On-premises to Runtime Manager. Then all control can be done from Runtime Manager.


Anypoint Runtime Manager CANNOT ensure automatic HA. Clusters/Server Groups etc should be configured before hand.

API implementations can run successfully in customer-hosted Mule runtimes, even when they are unable to communicate with the control plane. 
There are several references below to justify this statement.1

Below TWO are characteristics of Integration Tests but NOT unit tests:

>> They test the validity of input and output of source and target systems.
>> They must be triggered by an external client tool or event source.

It is NOT TRUE that Unit Tests must be run in a unit testing environment with dedicated Mule runtimes for the environment.
MuleSoft offers MUnit for writing Unit Tests and they run in an embedded Mule Runtime without needing any separate/ dedicated Runtimes to execute them. 
They also do NOT need any external connectivity as MUnit supports mocking via stubs.
